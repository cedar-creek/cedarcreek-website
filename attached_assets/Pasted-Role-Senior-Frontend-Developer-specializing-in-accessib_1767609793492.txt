Role: Senior Frontend Developer specializing in accessibility and conversion optimization

Task: Address critical UX and accessibility issues in the recent visual simplification commit (8152d6b) while preserving the clean, elite aesthetic. 

Critical Fixes Required: 

1. Solutions Section - Restore Feature Transparency
Problem: Removing all feature bullets may hurt conversion by hiding value proposition. 
Fix: Add a collapsible "View Full Scope" accordion under each engagement tier card that reveals the feature list.  Use a subtle "↓ Details" button that expands inline.  Keep it collapsed by default to maintain visual simplicity.

2. Hero Section - Mobile Responsiveness
Problem: The horizontal outcome bar may wrap awkwardly on mobile devices.
Fix: 
- Add responsive breakpoints:  stack vertically on screens < 640px
- Ensure adequate spacing between items when wrapped
- Test on iPhone SE (375px) and standard mobile (414px) widths

3. Accessibility - Semantic Icons
Problem: Using text dash "—" as decorative element lacks semantic meaning.
Fix: Replace text dashes with proper icon components (use lucide-react's Minus or CheckCircle2) and add aria-hidden="true" since they're decorative. Ensure parent containers have proper ARIA labels.

4. Color Contrast - WCAG Compliance
Problem: text-neutral-600 on light backgrounds may fail WCAG AA standards.
Fix: In approach-section.tsx, change text-neutral-600 to text-neutral-700 or text-neutral-800 to ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio.  Verify the inline text-primary highlights also meet contrast requirements.

5. SEO Recovery - Metadata
Problem: Removed descriptive text contained important keywords.
Fix: Ensure removed hero descriptions are incorporated into: 
- Page meta description tag
- H2 or H3 subheadings elsewhere on the page
- Or add them as visually-hidden text for screen readers and SEO

Implementation Notes:
- Maintain the current clean aesthetic - no visual regression
- Use framer-motion for smooth accordion animations
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable
- Test on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox
- Verify mobile touch targets are minimum 44x44px

Deliverable: Updated component files with these fixes implemented, maintaining the "elite boutique" design language.
