Prompt 1: Create New General Contact Form
This prompt now includes instruction Step 5 to add the privacy blurb.

Replit Agent Instruction: Please create a new React component for a General Contact Form.

Fields:

Business Name (Optional)

First Name (Required)

Last Name (Required)

Email Address (Required, with validation)

Message (Required, textarea)

Security: Integrate Google reCAPTCHA v3 to prevent spam. Use environment variables for the Site and Secret keys.

Integration: Upon a successful, verified submission, use the ClickUp API to create a new task in our designated "Leads" list.

Task Title: New Lead: [First Name] [Last Name] - [Business Name]

Task Description: Include the sender's email and the full message body.

Tags: Add the tag contact form to the task.

UI: Ensure the form matches the site's dark-themed boutique aesthetic with clear success/error messaging.

Privacy Assurance: Below the submit button and reCAPTCHA area, add the following text in a smaller, subtle grey font (e.g., text-sm text-gray-500): "Your data is secured with 256-bit SSL encryption and is used solely for direct communication. Cedar Creek never shares client information with third parties."

Prompt 2: Visual & UX Refinements for Current Form
(Unchanged from previous iteration, included here for easy copying)

Replit Agent Instruction: Please perform the following UI/UX fixes on the current multi-step audit form:

Button Visibility (Contrast Fix): The "Back" button currently has a grey-on-grey color scheme that is unreadable. Update the CSS to ensure a high-contrast ratio (at least 4.5:1). Suggestion: Use a transparent border with white text or a lighter grey background #4B5563 with white text.

Line Height Correction: In the ColdFusion Expertise section (specifically the "Do you require SQL Server Optimization?" radio group), the text is currently overlapping or too tight.

Target the container for these questions and set a line-height of 1.5 or 1.6 to improve legibility.

Ensure there is adequate vertical spacing (margin-bottom) between the question text and the radio button options.

Consistency: Verify that the primary "Next" or "Submit" buttons maintain our brand color #FF6B00.
