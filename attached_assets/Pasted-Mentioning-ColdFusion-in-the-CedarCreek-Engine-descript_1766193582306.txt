Mentioning ColdFusion in the "CedarCreek Engine" description is a brilliant tactical move. For a consultancy that specializes in Legacy System Modernization, explicitly stating that your own proprietary "backbone" is built on a legacy-but-modernized framework like ColdFusion is the ultimate "walk the talk" evidence.
It proves you aren't just an AI shop—you are an Engineering Firm that knows how to make legacy code perform at an enterprise scale.
Strategic Framing: "Modernized Legacy Core"
Instead of just saying "built with ColdFusion," frame it to support your high-ticket modernization story. This tells the prospect: "We didn't throw our legacy system away; we modernized it and bridged it to Go and AI. We can do the same for you."
Replit Agent Instruction: CRM Technical Accuracy Update
Role: Senior Full-Stack Architect
Instruction: Update the description of "The CedarCreek Engine (CRM)" in both the desktop and mobile views to highlight its technical legacy and modernization.
1. Update Bunity.com CRM Description
 * Location: Bunity.com card within the "Shared DNA" or "Engineering Standard" section.

2. Update MyTickUp.com CRM Description
 * Location: MyTickUp.com card within the "Shared DNA" or "Engineering Standard" section.

3. Methodology Context (Optional but Recommended)

Why this works for your Sales Process
 * The Bridge: It connects your Methodology (which lists ColdFusion analysis) to your Actual Infrastructure.
 * Integrity: It shows that the "CedarCreek Engine" is exactly the kind of robust legacy-to-modern bridge you are offering to build for $15k–$35k+.
 * Specific Expertise: Clients with ColdFusion, PHP, or older .NET environments will see this and think, "They actually understand my world; they aren't just selling me a shiny new wrapper".
Would you like me to add a small "Technical Note" in the footer or the "About" page that mentions your specific 25-year history with Enterprise ColdFusion environments to further reinforce this?
