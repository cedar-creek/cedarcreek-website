Role: Senior Brand Strategist & UX Architect

Instruction: Refine the CedarCreek.ai site to eliminate narrative conflicts, enhance hero-area conversion, and reposition the "Lab" as a trust-builder rather than a distraction.

1. Reconcile the "Scale Narrative" (Global Fix)
Update all statistics to reflect a single, consistent story of scale. We will use the Bunity-supported "Global Scale" combined with "Strategic Depth".

"Our Foundation" Tiles (About Page): Keep 25+ Years, 5,000+ Clients Served, and 50+ Industries.

"Engineering Roots" Paragraph (About Page): Update text to match: “Our roots are in complex systems architecture. We have served more than 5,000 clients globally, addressing the specialized localized demands of over 190 countries.”.

Homepage Hero Stat: Ensure it reads: "powering SaaS for 5,000+ clients across 50+ industries and 190+ countries.".

2. Hero Area "Outcome Bullets" (Homepage)
Add a clean, 3-bullet "Outcomes" row directly below the Hero CTA buttons to speak to business value.

Bullet 1: Reduce manual workflows and reporting time.

Bullet 2: Safer modernization via incremental, risk-mitigated rollouts.

Bullet 3: AI integration that respects business logic and data reality.

3. Narrative Sharpening: "Why We Exist" (About Page)
Tighten the opener to be more concrete and readable.

New Text: "We combine deep systems engineering with business-first prioritization. We modernize architecture without losing the business logic that makes it valuable.".

4. Reposition "The Lab" (Homepage)
Frame the Lab as evidence of engineering excellence ("dogfooding").

New Section Header: "The CedarCreek Lab: Proven Standards in Practice".

New Description: "We dogfood our own architectural standards internally. The Lab is where we build and test the same high-scale engines we deploy for our clients.".

Bunity Description: Ensure it reads: "Showcasing over 30 Million Businesses in Over 190 Countries".

5. Final CTA & Component Sync
Widget Rename: Rename the side-sticky widget to "Request Your Audit".

Funnel Alignment: Ensure all "Get Started" and "Custom Plan" buttons lead to the "Initiate Discovery" intake form.
