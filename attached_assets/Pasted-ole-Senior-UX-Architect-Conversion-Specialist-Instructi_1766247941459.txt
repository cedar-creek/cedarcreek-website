Instruction: Perform final polish on the Homepage and About page to improve readability, orient the user toward business outcomes, and clarify the consultative model.

1. Homepage: "Outcomes Row" Implementation
Directly under the Hero section (below the primary CTA buttons), add a horizontal 3-bullet "Outcomes" strip to provide an immediate value-at-a-glance.

Column 1 (Operational Gain): Performance Optimization. Eliminate manual workflows and reduce reporting time across legacy infrastructure.

Column 2 (Risk Mitigation): Resilient Modernization. Safer rollouts through incremental, risk-mitigated engineering pathways.

Column 3 (Strategic AI): AI-Ready Foundations. Implement AI integration that respects your proprietary business logic and data reality.

2. Visual Polish: Metric Readability & Typography
Target Impact Metrics: Increase the font size and contrast of the labels beneath the big numbers to ensure they are instantly legible on desktop and mobile.

Widow Prevention: Ensure text-wrap: balance remains active on these metrics and all subheadlines.

3. The Lab: Strategic Framing
Add a single anchoring sentence directly above "The CedarCreek Lab" section to clarify its purpose as a validation tool.

Text: "We build and operate our own global systems to validate our modernization standards in real-world conditions.".

Scale Update: Ensure the Bunity card description reads: "Showcasing over 30 Million Businesses in Over 190 Countries".

4. Solution Tiers: Scope Differentiation
Add a "Best For" line to the top of each engagement card to help buyers self-select.

Strategic Discovery: Best for auditing legacy technical debt and defining a 5-day modernization roadmap.

Strategic Partnership: (Badge: STRATEGIC STANDARD) Best for high-scale modernization of core systems using Go and Svelte.

Enterprise Partnership: Best for multi-system digital transformation and long-term architectural support.

5. About Page: Rhythmic Refinement
Update the "Why We Exist" block for a sharper rhythmic flow.

New Text: "We modernize complex architecture without losing the unique business logic that defines its value. We reside at the crossroads of deep systems engineering and business-first prioritization.".

6. Global Sidebar & Heritage Check
Side Widget: Rename the floating CTA to "Request Your Audit" and ensure it is functional on the /privacy and /terms pages.

Footer Heritage: Confirm copyright reads: "© 1998 – 2025 Cedar Creek Ltd. All rights reserved.".
