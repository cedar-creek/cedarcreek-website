You are absolutely right. To provide you with more flexibility during sales conversations and avoid pinning yourself to a rigid number on the public site, using "Starting at" or "From" is a much better approach.
Here is the revised prompt for your Replit Agent. It updates the pricing to be "Starting at" and reinforces your core business of legacy modernization without the marketing/SEO fluff.
Updated Replit Agent Instruction Prompt
Role: Expert Full-Stack Developer & UI/UX Designer
Context: I am pivoting CedarCreek.AI to focus on our true core strength: Legacy System Modernization & AI Integration. We specialize in moving businesses from legacy code (ColdFusion) to modern, AI-ready stacks (Go, Svelte, Ionic).
Please perform the following updates:
1. Strategic Pivot & Content Removal
 * Remove all mentions of SEO, marketing automation, social media content, or blog generation.
 * New Core Message: Focus the site on "System Automation" and "Legacy Modernization".
 * Legacy Focus: Explicitly mention expertise in ColdFusion modernization and SQL Server optimization.
2. Pricing & Solutions (Flexible Model)
Update the three tiers using "Starting at" language to allow for custom scoping:
 * Rapid Start Accelerator: "Starting at $15,000." Focus on AI Readiness Assessments and identifying legacy modules for quick-win automation.
 * Growth Accelerator: "Starting at $35,000." Focus on technical modernization, including migrating core functions to Go (Golang) microservices and Svelte interfaces.
 * Enterprise Accelerator: "Custom Pricing." Focus on full-scale digital transformation, Ionic Framework mobile apps, and 12-month strategic support.
3. Technical Expertise Section
Rewrite the "Technical Expertise" section to highlight these four specific pillars:
 * Legacy Modernization: ColdFusion enhancement, monolithic-to-microservice migration, and SQL performance tuning.
 * Backend Systems: High-concurrency microservices and APIs developed in Go (Golang).
 * Modern Frontends: High-performance, reactive user interfaces built with Svelte.
 * Mobile Platforms: Cross-platform mobile application development using the Ionic Framework.
4. Managing Expectations (ROI & Results)
 * Language Shift: Change all ROI mentions to "Target Impact Metrics" or "Success Benchmarks".
 * Disclaimer: Add a footer or small-print note: "Results vary by client environment. Metrics represent targeted performance improvements based on industry benchmarks".
 * Focus: Emphasize "Process Time Reduction" and "System Efficiency" over "Revenue Gains" to keep expectations grounded in technical performance.
5. Updated Call to Action (CTA)
 * Primary Button: Change to "Get Your Custom AI Acceleration Plan".
 * Lead Magnet: Mention that the plan is delivered within 24 hours and identifies high-impact automation opportunities.
Would you like me to help you draft a specific "Case Study" section that describes a hypothetical ColdFusion-to-Go migration to show potential clients how the process works?
